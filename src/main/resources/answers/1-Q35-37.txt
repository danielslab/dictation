Excuse me. I tried to pay for parking at the machine, but it doesn't seem to be working. It won't accept cash or my credit card.
Oh, I'm sorry. The machine is currently out of order. There was supposed to be a sign posted about that. But you can pay me here at the booth.
OK, I entered the parking garage forty-five minutes ago, so how much do I owe?
If you've been here under an hour, parking is free, but I still need to validate your parking ticket so you can exit.
