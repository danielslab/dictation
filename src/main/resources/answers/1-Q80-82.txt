Hi, Chef Bertrand, this is Shelley calling from the restaurant kitchen.
We just got today's fresh produce delivery, and I'm a bit concerned.
There are quite a few extra vegetables here that aren't on our usual order list, but I don't remember any special events being scheduled this week, and I don't see any listed on the calendar.
Did you order anything special?
I was going to call the supplier, but I thought I should check with you first.
So, uh, remember I need to finish the kitchen inventory this morning and it's already ten o'clock.
Thanks.
