Hi, I've just unloaded the last box of bathroom tiles. The whole delivery's in your warehouse now. Would you be able to sign for them? I need a signature.
I'm sorry; this is my first day on the job. I'd better check with the warehouse manager to see if I'm allowed to do that.
Should I wait here while you check?
Actually, if you wouldn't mind moving your truck, that'd be great, since we're expecting some other deliveries shortly.
