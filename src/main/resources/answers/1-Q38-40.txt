Steve, you mentioned you wanted to see that new Janet Carmen film.
Mhm.
Well, some of us in the department are going to see it tonight.
That sounds great, but I probably won't leave work until around seven. What time are you going?
We were planning on going at six thirty. Sure you can't come to that?
Yeah... I haven't finished this month's sales report yet. Are there any later showings?
Well, there is another one at nine o'clock, but I don't know if the others want to go that late. I'll talk to them and let you know.
