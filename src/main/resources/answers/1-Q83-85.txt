Joan McLane, our guest lecturer tonight, began her distinguished work as an economist right here in New York City.
She has long been recognized as an expert on Asian economic development.
Companies have come to value her thorough understanding of what it takes to do business in Beijing, Tokyo, and Seoul.
Recently, Ms. McLane has given expert advice on the Chinese market to one of the largest car manufacturers in the world.
We're very fortunate that she can speak to us tonight.
On behalf of the Dixon Research Institute, I'm pleased to welcome Joan McLane.
