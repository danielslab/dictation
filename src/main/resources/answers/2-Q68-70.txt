Hi, Jim. I hear you're going to the jazz concert on Friday. Can I ask you a favor?
Sure, what do you need?
A few of us from the graphics department are also attending the concert, but we have a meeting until six o'clock on Friday. Since there are no assigned seats, we were wondering if you could save a few places for us.
That shouldn't be a problem. I don't have any meetings on Friday afternoon, so I plan to get there when the doors open. How many should I reserve?
Hmm I'm not sure yet if Eduardo is joining us. Why don't I send him an e-mail right now, and I'll let you know how many seats to save.
