Hi, this is Laura Dunn.
l'm calling about a catering order you just delivered for our corporate luncheon this afternoon.
I just realized that one of the food trays we ordered wasn't included we're missing the pasta.
Now, between the sushi and the chicken dish, we'll have enough food, but I wanted to make sure we get a refund on the pasta.
Could you please process the refund to the same credit card I used to place the order?
Thanks and have a nice day.
