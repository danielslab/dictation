Hi, Mariko, this is Francois Ouchamp calling from Human Resources.
We're supposed to begin posting the laboratory assistant position this Friday.
But, I don't know, have you seen the interview questions we use?
Since you supervise the laboratory employees, l'd really be interested in your opinion of them.
It would be great if you have some time today to talk about this.
I'm about to go to an early lunch, but I'll be at my desk until five o'clock this afternoon.
Thanks.
