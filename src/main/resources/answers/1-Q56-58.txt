Hi, Peter, this is Tanya Bryant. You helped me find an apartment last year. I was wondering if your agency could help me find a new one in the same neighborhood.
Oh-hi, Tanya. I'd be happy to help. You're currently in the Mount Eldon area, aren't you?
Yes, and I really like it. But I've recently set up my own business, designing jewelry and selling it online, so I'd like to find a two-bedroom apartment. I need to have another room to use as an office.
I have several apartments I could show you. How's your afternoon?
