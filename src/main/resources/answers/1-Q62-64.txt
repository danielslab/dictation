We've chosen an advertising firm to promote the new Colossus Tractor we're making. Several of the firm's representatives will be visiting next week, and I've planned for you to give them a tour of the assembly line on Tuesday. Is that OK?
Well, I'm having some of our production equipment serviced right now, so they wouldn't be able to see the assembly line in full operation. The next day, Wednesday, would be better for the tour.
OK. The advertising reps are planning to leave Wednesday evening, but I think we should be able to squeeze in a tour during the morning. I'll give them a call right now to make sure this time change is OK.
