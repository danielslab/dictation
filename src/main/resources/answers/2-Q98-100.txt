Welcome to your first day at The Harling Company!
Your role in handling customer inquiries over the phone will be crucial to our sales.
Here's your training calendar.
So, today, we'll get you set up and we'll teach you the basics of the job.
Then, for the rest of the week you'll be trained one-on-one by your manager.
You'll practice answering the phones and receive feedback at the end of the week on your interaction with the customers.
You'll really enjoy working with your managers, you'll see they're great!
Oh, and one more thing the company president wants to meet all of you.
So she organized a team lunch to welcome you all.
