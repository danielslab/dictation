Hi, I'd like to have this dress cleaned. I'm going to a conference at the end of this week, and I'd like to take it with me. Oh, and can you tell me how much it'll cost?
Let me take a look it's going to be twelve dollars.
Oh, that much? Your sign out front says dresses can be cleaned from seven dollars and up.
Well yes, but it's the material the dress is made of. We have to use special cleaning products to make sure we don't damage the fabric.
OK.
I can rush the service and have it to you by Wednesday evening. Does that work?
