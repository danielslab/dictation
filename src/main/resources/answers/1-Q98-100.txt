Alright everyone, here's the breakdown of this year's video-game market shares.
We're still among the top four gaming companies, but we need to pay attention to DTQ's rapid growth-they just surpassed us.
We're not that far behind at seventeen percent, but we need to keep up.
Our market experts attribute DTQ's expansion to its new business model.
DTQ now offers its games for free, with consumers making extra purchases during the game.
We think this business approach could also help us attract new users, so in the next quarter we're going to try it out with some of our existing games to see if we can grow beyond our seventeen-percent market share.
