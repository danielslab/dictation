Good evening!
l'm so glad you all could make it tonight to celebrate our company's expansion.
When I first started this greeting card company, it was only a small team of three people struggling to make our business work.
And now we have twenty full-time employees, we've expanded our distribution, and we even have a new, much larger office space.
So please, before you leave the banquet, pick up your gift bag.
It's my personal token of appreciation to thank all of you for your contribution to our company's success.
