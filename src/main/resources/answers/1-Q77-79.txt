And now for the Radio 10 Community Bulletin Board.

The event features tours of several local gardens, which have been designed and planted by club members.
Tickets are available for ten dollars each on the club's Web site, www.RiverdaleGardenClub.com.
Money raised from the sale of tickets will be used to repair the fountain in Riverdale Park.
