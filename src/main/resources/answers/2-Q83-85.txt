This is Scott Ourlin, and you're listening to Scott's Money Advice on WYBR Radio Ninety-One, where we discuss how to handle all types of money and home-budget topics.
I want to let listeners know, that as of today, you can download audio files of past broadcasts of our show from my newly updated Web site, www.scottsadvice.com.
This is in addition to the usual links and interactive features on topics from the show.
And I always like to hear from you, so please e-mail me any money questions you might have.
I'll be sure to answer them on the air.
Now let's return to our discussion of what to do when buying a car, with our guest, Nina Robinson.
