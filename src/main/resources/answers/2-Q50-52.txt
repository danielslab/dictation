Thabo and Michiko, I need help designing some pamphlets for our evening business courses. I'd like to have them ready before the end of April.
Sure. Should we take a look at the ones from last year or make them different?
You know, I think the pamphlets last year had too many details. People can get dates and times from the Web site.
I agree. Let's focus on the skills that people will learn in each class.
OK. I'll come up with a rough version of the text for the pamphlet by tomorrow and e-mail it to you. Then, next week we can start working on the design.
