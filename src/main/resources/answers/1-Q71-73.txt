Hi, Ms. Saldana, Othis is Ricardo Valdez from Wagner's Home Furnishings.
I'm calling about Othe dining table and chairs that you recently bought at our store.
It appears that we made a mistake in entering your address into our customer files.
When we tried to deliver your items, our truck driver found that the address we had for you didn't exist!
When you get a chance, please call back and give us your correct address.
The truck's going out again tomorrow morning, so if you call us by five PM, we can deliver the dining set sometime tomorrow.
