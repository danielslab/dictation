Hi Karen, I wonder if you can help me. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow afternoon, so I need someone to take my shift at the restaurant.
No problem I can do that. Would you cover my shift next Monday evening in exchange?
Of course. I'll let the supervisor know about the change in schedule right now.
