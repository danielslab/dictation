Hello, this message is for Mr. Lehman.
This is Mei Li from Sun Central Pharmacy.
I'm calling to let you know that your doctor called in your prescription for allergy pills earlier today.
We usually have that medication in stock, but unfortunately, we ran out yesterday.
We'll get a new shipment in tomorrow, though.
Your prescription will be ready for you to pick up after two P.M.
Please come by the front desk of the pharmacy when you stop in tomorrow.
Thank you and have a good evening.
