OK, Ms. Torres, I have your price estimate. To have the whole exterior of your house painted, including the fence, will cost you five thousand dollars.
That's quite a bit more than we expected. And actually Colgate Painting said they would do it for four thousand dollars.
Well, the cost of paint and supplies is included in the price I quoted you, so we really offer a very good deal.
That's a bit of a relief. If there are no other charges, we'll probably be able to stay within our budget.
