Hello, this is Sy'lvia Chen.
I recently purchased a camera from your online shop.
Unfortunately, when the camera arrived, the lens was scratched.
I want to bring it to the post office this afternoon to return it for an exchange, but I'd like to speak to someone from your company before I mail it.
You see, I'm moving to a new house next week, so the replacement will have to be shipped to my new address.
Please call me back so I can be sure your shipping department will send the camera to the correct address.
