Hello. I saw a flyer about your research project on diet and nutrition. Are you still looking for participants for that study?
Yes, we still need about ten more participants. But in order to take part in the study, you'll have to run, swim, or cycle for at least two hours each week. Is that OK?
Yes, but I don't have time to participate during the day because I work until six P.M. Is that a problem?
No, that'd be fine. There are only a few appointments we'd need to schedule. Why don't I e-mail you a copy of the consent form? It has a description of the study.
