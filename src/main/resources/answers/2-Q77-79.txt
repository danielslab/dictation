Helio Alborada Apartments residents.
Thank you for letting me speak at tonight's tenant meeting.
My name is Jay, and I'm the new maintenance manager for the complex.
In my first few days as maintenance manager, I've realized that many of you are having problems with the air conditioning in your apartments.
So my crew and I will be coming around to each apartment over the next three weeks to inspect all the air conditioning units and decide which ones need to be replaced.
The good news is, the pool will be opening for the summer next week.
Don't forget to collect your pool passes from the main office on Monday.
