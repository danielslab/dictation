Hi Tom. Are you still planning to join us when we interview Pim Juntasa on Wednesday? She seems like a really promising candidate.
Yes, you can count on me. I'll be there at two P.M. The usual place, right? Meeting Room A?
No. Actually, someone's already booked Meeting Room A. So, instead, we'll be in the small meeting room on the first floor.
Good to know, thanks. Oh, and I've revised the interview questions. I'll pass out photocopies of them to everyone before Wednesday.
