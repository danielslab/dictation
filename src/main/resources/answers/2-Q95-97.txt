Good morning and thanks for inviting me to this board meeting.
You asked me to find ways for our company to become more environmentally friendly, so here's what I came up with.
Here are four options for desktop management software.
After business hours, when most computers are not in use, these programs will automatically turn off our computers, saving costs and energy.
All are compatible with the hardware we use, and the projected savings are comparable for all four software systems.
However, only one has a system for backing up data in an emergency.
So that's the one I recommend.
