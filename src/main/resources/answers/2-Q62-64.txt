Hi. I'm going on a trip, and I'm interested in buying an electronic reader so I don't have to carry books with me.
Well, we carry all major brands of e-readers here I'm sure we can find the right one for you.
Oh, good.
Are you looking for any special features?
It has to be user-friendly I'm not very good with technology. I just want to read books not watch movies or play games.
In that case, I'd suggest this one. It's very easy to download e-books onto it, and it holds up to three hundred books. Here, let me show you how it works.
