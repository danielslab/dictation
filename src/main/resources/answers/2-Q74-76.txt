Now, turning to local news, the annual Art Walk festival will be held this Saturday.
The festival offers residents the chance to discover local art galleries and to talk with gallery owners and artists.
The walk starts at the Clareton City Hall, where you'll receive a map showing all the participating galleries.
And this year, for the first time, food from local restaurants will be available at each gallery.
Information about parking for the event can be found on the city's Web site.
