Customer service, Mark speaking. How can I help you?
Hi, Mark. I bought a chair from your store, and I was about to assemble it, but I don't think I have all of the parts I need.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know what you're missing?
Well, I have all the long bolts for the legs but none of the other bolts for the seat.
OK, I have some replacement parts here at the store, and I can have the delivery driver drop them off at your house this afternoon. How does that sound?
That'd be great, thanks!
