Hello, I'm calling because I'd like to temporarily stop my mail delivery, I'm going to be out of town for the next two weeks.
Certainly, We can hold your mail here at the post office for you, But you'll need to put in your request at least a day before you leave.
That sounds great. Do I need to come into the office and complete a form?
No, actually, you have to submit the hold mail form on our Web site.
