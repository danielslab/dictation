Hi, I'm Petra Barlow. I have an interview for a position in the accounting department here at Houseman Incorporated.
Hello, Ms. Barlow. Let me check in the computer. While I do that, would you put on this visitor's badge so it's easy to see?
Yes, of course. I'm supposed to meet with Helen Wade in Meeting Room 2B. Is that right?
Actually, it looks like there was a last-minute change. You'll be meeting in Room 12A instead. It's down that hallway and to your left.
Thanks a lot!
