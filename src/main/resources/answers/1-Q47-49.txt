Are you sure you're going the right way to the conference center? It's taking longer than I expected, and I'm worried we're not going to get there on time.
I thought this was the right way, but now I'm not sure. I did have driving directions that came with the conference materials - too bad I forgot to bring them with me.
I say we'd better stop and find somebody who can help us out. I see a store up ahead. Maybe someone there can tell us which way to go.
