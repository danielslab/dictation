Hi Ken, hi Julio! How did the art gallery opening go last weekend? Was the client happy with the marketing materials?
Alfredo? He was very pleased. He said he thought the brochures we designed were one of the main reasons for such a great turnout.
And it's worth checking out the gallery when you have some time. I'm sure Alfredo would be happy to give you a tour.
Yes, the place is so bright and modern, with a fantastic collection of local works of art.
You know, I'm taking a vacation in that area in February. I'll make a point of visiting him.
