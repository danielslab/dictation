Hi, I'm with Spellman Technologies, and I'm calling to thank you and your company for the great job you did catering for our business luncheon last week.
Oh, don't thank me. Your event was planned by my colleague, Nadia. I'm sure she'll be happy to hear that you were pleased.
If Nadia's in the office, I'd like to tell her myself.
Actually, she's out today. But I can put you through to her voice mail so that you can leave her a message.
