Hello, Oscar it's Tanya from the Cardona Museum. Unfortunately our budget's been cut, so we'll have to delay some of the renovations we've asked you to do.
Ah that's too bad. Do you know which parts of the project you'd like to put off?
Well, I know we talked about adding a library wing on the west side of the building but that's very expensive. So, if we don't make that addition, that's all we may need to cut.
You know, that's not a bad idea. Let's see how much you'd save if I take the library out of the renovation proposal. I'll e-mail you a revised estimate this afternoon.
