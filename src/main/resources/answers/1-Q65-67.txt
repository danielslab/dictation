Hi Lydia, this is Oliver, your editor at European Travels Magazine. Is now a good time to chat?
Sure, I have a minute .
Great. Would you be able to increase the word count for your Exploring Sicily article to 2,000 words?
OK, there's plenty to cover on the topic. But I have another article due that same day.
Aha, I see that on your assignment chart. Let's extend the deadline for your other assignment by a week that way you can focus on Sicily.
Thanks I appreciate it. By the way, I've been compiling some ideas for pieces to write this summer. I'll send them to you later today for feedback.
