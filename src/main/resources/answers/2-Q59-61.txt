Hi, Gabriella. I wanted to talk to you about using the new online time reporting system A lot of people have been asking about it.
Yes, well, I've been very busy. But I am planning the training session for early next week. That should make it quite clear to everyone.
OK. But isn't there any written documentation?
What do you mean?
You know, a guide that staff can follow in the meantime.
I don't think that's necessary. I'll have everyone go through the steps with me in the computer lab. Then they'll know exactly what to do. It's very simple.
