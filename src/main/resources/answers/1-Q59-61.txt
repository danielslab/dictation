Hello, Amanda. Oo you have a few minutes to discuss the feedback I received on the training seminar I presented to the new engineers last week?
Sure! I heard that the comments were generally very positive. The new hires said your explanations were very clear.
Yes. However, they did mention that it was a lot of information to absorb in a short time. I was thinking that the next time I do this, I'd give them a break halfway through the seminar. What do you think?
That's a good idea. And maybe you could also set aside a half hour at the end so you'll have more time to answer all of the trainees' questions.
