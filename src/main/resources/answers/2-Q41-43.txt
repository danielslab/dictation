Good afternoon, I currently subscribe to your Gold Plan satellite television package, I'd like to switch to the Platinum Plan because there are some new movie channels that I'd like to watch.
Of course, I'd be happy to help you upgrade your subscription. Could you spell your last name for me so that I can look up your account?
Yes, it's K-W-A-N , When should I expect to have access to the extra channels?
Your account will reset tomorrow at six A.M. so you'll be able to watch them first thing in the morning, I just want to remind you that an extra fifteen dollars will appear on your next monthly bill for this expanded service.
