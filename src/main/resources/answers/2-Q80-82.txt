Hi, everyone.
Today we have some urgent business to attend to.
I just received word that Moon-Hee Lee will be making a visit to our store tomorrow.
For those of you who don't know, Ms. Lee is our regional manager, who oversees five stores in the area including this one.
Now, it's very important that we give her a good impression, so I'm requesting that everyone stay a bit late today to help get the store cleaned and organized.
And, since you'll be working extra hours today, you can each select a morning to take off next week.
Just let me know which day you choose to come in later, so I can update the schedule.
