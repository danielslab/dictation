Hello, may I speak to Min-Jae Park? It's about the renovations to Comet Bank. He's the architect, right?
Yes. But may I ask who's calling?
This is Sheryl Reed, the project manager for the Comet Bank renovations. I'm missing the drawings with the measurements for the main entrance, and I'm ordering the doors today.
OK, I'll put you through to Mr. Park. Please hold.
Thanks.
Hello? Ms. Reed?
Hello, Mr. Park. Could you possibly get me another blueprint? I can't find the drawings for the front entrance.
Certainly. Ms. Reed. It'll take some time to print the plan, though. If you come by my office around three o'clock, I'll have it ready for you by then.
